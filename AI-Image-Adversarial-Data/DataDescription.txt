Below is the data description for the dataset used to evaluate the reliability and resilience of image recognition systems under adversarial conditions, created by Faddi et al. (2024).

This subfolder contains two datasets used to investigate the performance of CNNs on both clean and perturbed image inputs:
1. Failure count dataset, which records the training and evaluation of the CNNs. 
2. Failure time dataset, which uses the index of misclassified images as the failure time.

For the data dictionary of these specific datasets, please refer to the paper "Bridging the Data Gap in AI Reliability Research and Establishing DR-AIR: A Comprehensive Data Repository for AI Reliability".
