GENERAL SUMMARY
---------------
The original dataset was downloaded from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) website and cleaned in the following DR-AIR paper:

Zheng, S., J. M. Clark, F. Salboukh, P. Silva, K. da Mata, F. Pan, J. Min, J. Lian, C. B. King, L. Fiondella, et al. (2025). "Bridging the data gap in AI reliability research and establishing DR-AIR: A comprehensive data repository for AI reliability." arXiv preprint arXiv:2502.12386.

This subfolder contains three separate .csv files, each providing information on:

1. Collision events focusing on four manufacturers: Waymo, Cruise, Pony AI, and Zoox.

2. Mileage data for all vehicles over a 24-month period (e.g., from November 30, 2017, to November 30, 2019).

3. A monthly summary file providing details for each month, enabling the calculation of daily mileage for autonomous vehicles and supporting further reliability analysis.

DATA SUMMARY
------------
The California DMV Collision Dataset is a publicly available resource provided by the California DMV. It documents autonomous vehicle (AV) collision events â€” instances in which a self-driving car was involved in an actual crash during testing on public roads in California. Because it captures multiple collisions over time for each vehicle, it is considered a recurrent event dataset.
