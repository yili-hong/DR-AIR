Below is the data description for the California DMV collision event datasets. The original dataset was downloaded from the California DMV website.

This subfolder contains three separate .csv files, each including information on:

1. Collision events focusing on four manufacturers: Waymo, Cruise, Pony AI, and Zoox.
2. Mileage information for all vehicles over a 24-month period (e.g., from November 30, 2017, to November 30, 2019).
3. A monthly information file providing details related to each month, enabling the calculation of daily mileage for autonomous vehicles and supporting further reliability analysis.
