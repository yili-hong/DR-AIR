This public GitHub repository contains eight files, as listed below:

1. README.md
2. DataList.csv: Contains a summary of the currently available datasets related to AI reliability.
3. AI-Incident-Data-2021: Corresponds to the general AI incident data in Section 4.1 of the paper.
4. AI-Classification-Algorithms-Data: Corresponds to Algorithm-Level Test Dataset 1 in Section 4.2 of the paper.
5. AI-Image-Adversarial-Data: Corresponds to Algorithm-Level Test Dataset 2 in Section 4.3 of the paper.
6. AI-Perception-System-Data: Corresponds to the module-level test data in Section 4.4 of the paper.
