GENERAL SUMMARY
---------------
The original dataset was downloaded from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) website and cleaned in the following paper:

Min, J., Y. Hong, C. B. King, and W. Q. Meeker (2022). "Reliability analysis of artificial intelligence systems using recurrent events data from autonomous vehicles." Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series C (Applied Statistics), 71, 987â€“1013.

This subfolder contains three separate .csv files, each providing information on:

1. Disengagement events focusing on four manufacturers: Waymo, Cruise, Pony AI, and Zoox.

2. Mileage data for all vehicles over a 24-month period (e.g., from November 30, 2017, to November 30, 2019).

3. A monthly summary file containing details for each month, enabling the calculation of daily mileage for autonomous vehicles and supporting further reliability analysis.

DATA SUMMARY
------------
The California DMV disengagement dataset is a publicly available resource provided by the California DMV. It documents autonomous vehicle (AV) disengagement events - instances where a human driver had to take control of a self-driving car during testing on public roads in California. Because it captures multiple disengagements over time for each vehicle, it is considered a recurrent event dataset.
