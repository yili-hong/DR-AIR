Below is the data description for the dataset containing module-level error events from AI systems in autonomous vehicles(AVs) across various driving scenarios, created by Pan et al. (2024).

The tested modules belong to the perception system, which includes cameras and LiDAR sensors. This AI system consists of three key modules: 2-dimensional (2-D) detection, 3-D detection, and object localization. The dataset was collected from a physics-based AV simulation platform, where an error injection framework was developed to efficiently generate error events from various AI system modules in AVs.
