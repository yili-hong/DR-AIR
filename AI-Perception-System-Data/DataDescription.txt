DATA SUMMARY
------------
The simulated modules tested in this dataset are part of the perception system, which includes cameras and LiDAR sensors. The AI perception system comprises three key components: 2D detection, 3D detection, and object localization. The dataset was generated using a physics-based AV simulation platform, within which an error injection framework was implemented to efficiently produce error events across the various AI system modules.
